            <h3>Our Story</h3>
            <p>ProTasker was born out of a simple need: to make project management more accessible, intuitive, and
                effective for everyone.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="about-content">
            <p>Founded in 2023, ProTasker began as a small team of project managers and developers who were frustrated
                with the complexity of existing tools. We believed project management software should adapt to your
                workflow, not the other way around.
            Today, ProTasker serves thousands of teams worldwide, from startups to Fortune 500 companies. Our mission
                remains the same: to provide powerful yet simple tools that help teams collaborate more effectively and
                deliver projects successfully.</p>
